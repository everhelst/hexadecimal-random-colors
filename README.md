# hexadecimal-random-colors


This repository contains an app that changes the background color randomly. It is based on an algorithm that iterates randomly to obtain the hexadecimal code that changes the background color.



For this project I used my knowledge of HTML. CSS, and Javascript (DOM, OOP)
